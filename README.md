# Bad Apple in RTTTL format

This is the main melody from nomico's Bad Apple in Nokia's RTTTL format. Created because it didn't seem to exist, somehow. You can listen to it using for example [this page](https://adamonsoon.github.io/rtttl-play/).

In case you don't want to open the RTTTL file, you can copy-paste it from the code block below:

`BadApple: d=8,o=5,b=138: 8d#, 8f, 8f#, 8g#, 4a#, 8d#6, 8c#6, 4a#, 4d#, 8a#, 8g#, 8f#, 8f, 8d#, 8f, 8f#, 8g#, 4a#, 8g#, 8f#, 8f, 8d#, 8f, 8f#, 8f, 8d#, 8d, 8f, 8d#, 8f, 8f#, 8g#, 4a#, 8d#6, 8c#6, 4a#, 4d#, 8a#, 8g#, 8f#, 8f, 8d#, 8f, 8f#, 8g#, 4a#, 8g#, 8f#, 4f, 4f#, 4g#, 4a#`

Created to play on a passive speaker for my electronics course, but you may use it as you please.
